#Problem 1 : Hardware counters

L1 cache, L2 cache and TLB misses were calculated. 

#Problem 2: Profile

Edge profile, Node profile and path profile were derived for various operations.

#Problem 3: Optimizing data layout and code structure

Task was to play with L2 cache and TLB memory. Basically, we were asked to de-optimize in such a way so that we get max L2 and TLB misses. 

Second was to minimise L2 cache miss by changing the structure of code. Structure of array, array of structure or any combination could have been used.

Then we were supposed to redesign the code in such a way that it would reduce L2 cache miss by changing the structure of code and memory optimization technique.
